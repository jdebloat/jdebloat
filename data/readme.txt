The old_benchmarks are the list of benchmarks that were used for the 2020 demo. 
However, some of those benchmarks do not build perfectly - the second order dependencies are not downloaded, or do not get added the final jar file for other reasons. These faultly benchmarks were dropped.

The new_benchmarks only contains the benchmarks that build correctly.

To add a new benchmark, simply add a link to its github site, along with the commit number.
